# Novel-Round-Robin-Scheduling-Algorithm
This repository contains a novel Round Robin Scheduling Alggorithm and was created as part of our Operating System ProjectWork.
The uniqueness of thsi algorithm lies in the fact that unlike previous round robin scheduling algorithms this one uses a dynamic time quantum and a threshold value to calculate the gnatt chart.
Our work has been largely inspired from the work suggested in the research papers mentioned in references where a dynamic time quantum calculation is used.Our work includes improvements in the previous existing models by some amounts and is a vast improvement of the original Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm.The Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm uses a fixed value of time quantum which increases the context switching.Our aim has been to reduce the context switching.We take idea from the papers referenced and improve upon them using different techniques which include sorting the processes first based on arrival time then burst time;then using a dynamic time quantum by calculating the average of remaining burst time in the waiting queue and then using a threshold value to further preempt the working of processes. In a brief the idea suggested in this paper is a minor improvement over the previous mentioned round robin scheduling techniques and a significant improvement over the original Round Robin Scheduling in terms of context switching.
