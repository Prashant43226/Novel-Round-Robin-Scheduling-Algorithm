# Novel-Round-Robin-Scheduling-Algorithm
This repository contains a novel Round Robin Scheduling Alggorithm and was created as part of our Operating System ProjectWork.
The uniqueness of thsi algorithm lies in the fact that unlike previous round robin scheduling algorithms this one uses a dynamic time quantum and a threshold value to calculate the gnatt chart.
